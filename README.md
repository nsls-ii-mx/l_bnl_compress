  -V, --version         report version and version_date

```
The program reads a NeXus hdf5 file dataset following the Dectris 
FileWriter Eiger detector conventions and produces a new file dataset 
following the same conventions.

For the current release (1.1.3) the format does allow direct processing by XDS,
but does not yet conform to the requirements for fast_dp.  For fast_dp, conversion
of the output to miniCBFs is necessary at present.

## Installation Prerequisites

This is a python program that needs Python 3 running in a Linux-like environment. 
It was created on a Debian 12 system and tested on a RHEL8 environment.  It is 
not likely to work with a python version prior to 3.9.  A suitable python with 
many modules upon which l_bnl_compress.py depends can be provided by use 
of cctbx.python from the DIALS package.

The modules upon which this program depends are:

      sys
      os
      argparse
      numpy
      skimage
      h5py
      tifffile
      astropy
      glymur
      hdf5plugin
      tempfile
      numcodecs
      BytesIO
      PIL
      warnings
      subprocess
      threading
      time
      queue
      string

This version supports coarse-grained process-level parallelism in writing
the -H, -J, or -K compressions.  In the near future
we intend to upgrade to parallelism using concurrent.futures, which
will also require an upgrade to parallel hdf5 and parallel h5py.
In order to achieve reasonable timing without major use of parallelism
as many files as possible should be in memory.  Use of /dev/shm is
highly recommended.

## Supporting Data

See [https://zenodo.org/records/15376113](https://zenodo.org/records/15376113) for 3 data sets that are used to evaluate application of lossy compression for MX diffraction dat:   A lysosyme data set collected at 7500 eV to solve the S_SAD structure (Ly_01_22013); 
A thermolysin data set from a fragment screening campaign collection at the NSLS-II AMX beamline with a fragment bound (tlys-817_10982); 
A  CBASS Cap5 from Pseudomonas syringae as an activated tetramer with the cyclic dinucleotide 3'2'-c-diAMP ligand data set (Endo6_23AA_2v_502).

The CBASS Cap5 structure was published and deposited to the PDB site (8FMG.PDB and [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01220-(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01220-x). 
The 7500 eV lysosyme structure was solved using S_SAD phases initial compression results are published (9B7F.PDB and [https://doi.org/10.1107/S160057752400359X](https://doi.org/10.1107/S160057752400359X).
